mpv utilities
These are companion scripts for a media library, centered around mpv.io

The Lua scripts add some basic Edit Decision List functions that can be used while watching a video. 

The shell scripts provide means of displaying video on different ways, adding subtitles or audio and producing all kinds of random samples from a video library.

This is largely a personal project. I'm inclined to rewrite in python, just for the hell of it.
